This is an archive with materials related to PROJECT #2


===============================================================================
VHDL implementations of "selected" RISC-V processor Components. You will
need these in your Project 2, Part C:

---> (1) instruction_memory.vhd
---> (2) data_memory.vhd 
---> (3) mux2to1.vhd 
---> (4) register32bit.vhd 


===============================================================================
Other helpful related materials:

---> (1) fourbit_adder_testbench_vhdl/
This is the fourbit_adder design entity with a simple example of a TestBench
to use for simulations.

---> (2) Appendix_C_of_Textbook.pdf 
Textbook appendix with information on the implementation of the "Main Control" 
and "ALU Control" Components

---> (3) Overflow.pdf
Self-expalnatory.


===============================================================================
General Materials for brushing-up your VHDL coding. You can ignore these
if you feel good/confident about your VHDL coding skills:

---> (1) Tutorial.zip 
This is a Tutorial on how to use Vivado from Xilinx. The archive includes a
description Vivado_Tutorial.PDF, and other VHDL code files.

---> (2) BOOK_VHDL_Tutorial_Peter_J_Ashenden.pdf 
PDF copy of an open source book, written by one of the pioneers in VHDL standard! 

---> (3) VHDL_examples.zip 
Cris' examples of simple designs and their Testbenches. You may want to simulate 
the Testbenches to get more familiar with writing Testbenches in VHDL and 
doing simulations!
